# Email Thread Notes - Chrome Extension PRD

## Product Overview

### Vision Statement
Create a privacy-focused Chrome extension that allows users to attach private, persistent notes to email threads in both Gmail and Outlook web clients, enabling better email management and context retention without affecting the original email content or visibility to other recipients.

### Problem Statement
Users frequently need to keep track of internal notes, context, and follow-up items related to specific email conversations. Current solutions either:
- Require forwarding emails to self with notes (clutters inbox)
- Use external note-taking apps (lacks email context integration)
- Rely on email labels/categories (limited and visible to others)
- Use corporate add-ins (restricted by admin policies)

### Solution Summary
A lightweight Chrome extension that:
- Detects email threads in Gmail and Outlook web interfaces
- Provides a persistent Chrome sidebar panel with dual functionality (Thread Notes + All Notes)
- Stores all data locally using Chrome's storage API
- Maintains notes persistence across browser sessions and updates
- Works independently of corporate email policies
- Uses Chrome's native Side Panel API for seamless cross-platform integration

## Core Features

## 🚧 KNOWN LIMITATIONS (v2.2.0 - Sidebar Architecture)

### Platform Limitations
- **Chrome Only**: Firefox and other browsers not supported (Manifest V3 + Side Panel API requirement)
- **Chrome 114+**: Requires Chrome version 114 or higher for Side Panel API support
- **Download Notifications**: Chrome shows download notifications for automatic backups (unavoidable)

### Functional Limitations
- **No Rich Text**: Plain text notes only (no formatting, links, or images)
- **Thread Subject Detection**: May not capture subjects for all Gmail/Outlook interface variations
- **Manual Sidebar Activation**: Users must click extension icon to open sidebar panel

### Technical Limitations
- **URL-Based Detection**: Thread detection relies on email platform URL patterns which may change
- **Storage Quota**: Limited by Chrome extension storage quotas (~5MB)
- **Symbolic Link Dependency**: Cloud sync requires manual symbolic link setup

### User Experience Changes from Overlay
- **Sidebar Location**: Notes appear in browser sidebar instead of page overlay
- **Click-to-Open**: Sidebar requires explicit activation (no automatic floating buttons)
- **Persistent Panel**: Sidebar stays open across tabs (could be seen as pro or con)

### Security & Privacy Limitations
- **No Encryption**: Notes are stored unencrypted (local and cloud)
- **Account Detection**: Basic account isolation based on Gmail URL patterns
