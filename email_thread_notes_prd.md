# Email Thread Notes - Chrome Extension PRD

## Product Overview

### Vision Statement
Create a privacy-focused Chrome extension that allows users to attach private, persistent notes to email threads in both Gmail and Outlook web clients, enabling better email management and context retention without affecting the original email content or visibility to other recipients.

### Problem Statement
Users frequently need to keep track of internal notes, context, and follow-up items related to specific email conversations. Current solutions either:
- Require forwarding emails to self with notes (clutters inbox)
- Use external note-taking apps (lacks email context integration)
- Rely on email labels/categories (limited and visible to others)
- Use corporate add-ins (restricted by admin policies)

### Solution Summary
A lightweight Chrome extension that:
- Detects email threads in Gmail and Outlook web interfaces
- Provides a persistent Chrome sidebar panel with dual functionality (Thread Notes + All Notes)
- Stores all data locally using Chrome's storage API
- Maintains notes persistence across browser sessions and updates
- Works independently of corporate email policies
- Uses Chrome's native Side Panel API for seamless cross-platform integration

## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Platform Thread Detection
- **Gmail Support**: Detect conversation threads in Gmail web interface
- **Outlook Support**: Detect conversation threads in Outlook web (outlook.office365.com, outlook.live.com)
